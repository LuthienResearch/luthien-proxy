# Conversation Trace Development Notes

This directory collects the planning documents and post-mortems produced while
building the conversation trace view and the associated streaming refactor.

1. **01_initial_plan.md** – first pass at the problem statement, asset
   inventory, and intended architecture for the conversation trace feature.
2. **02_streaming_plan.md** – follow-up plan scoped to the streaming data
   contract and incremental refresh strategy developed mid-project.
3. **03_trace_view_postmortem.md** – retrospective written after the original
   multi-call trace view shipped, capturing gaps discovered during testing.
4. **04_streaming_postmortem.md** – postmortem describing the final streaming
   model, data flow, and the trade-offs made during the refactor.

Together these documents trace the progression from the initial design through
lessons learned and the eventual architecture that is now in the codebase.
