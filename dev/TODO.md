# TODO

## High Priority

- [ ] **Review Nov 21-22 commits for cleanup** - Critically review all commits from Nov 21-22 related to finish_reason and tool call fixes:
  - Check for any unnecessary changes that were made during debugging
  - Identify any broken code that was committed during scrambling
  - Clean up or revert any changes that don't belong
  - Ensure fixes are minimal and well-targeted
- [ ] **Add Claude Code / Codex e2e tests** - Create integration tests that catch streaming tool call bugs:
  - Test multi-tool-call responses with buffering policies (SimplePolicy, ToolCallJudgePolicy)
  - Verify exactly one `finish_reason` chunk at end of stream
  - Test first tool call content is preserved (not empty)
  - Consider using actual Claude Code or Codex as test clients if feasible
  - These tests would have caught the duplicate response and empty first tool call bugs
- [ ] **Policy Config UI - Connect to Backend** - Wire up the Policy Configuration UI to use real admin API:
  - Update `policy_config.js` to call `/admin/policy/enable` instead of mocking
  - Add admin key input/storage (prompt on first use, store in sessionStorage)
  - Fetch current policy from `/admin/policy/current` on page load
  - Implement policy discovery by fetching from `/admin/policy/list` (requires implementation)
  - Connect SSE to real `/activity/stream` for test detection
  - Add error handling UI for failed policy changes
  - Note: Backend APIs for policy management are now implemented (PolicyManager, admin routes)
- [ ] **Run Database Migration** - Apply the new policy_config table migration:
  - Run `migrations/001_add_policy_config_table.sql` against luthien_control database
  - Verify table creation and indexes
  - Test policy persistence by enabling a policy via admin API
- [ ] **Policy Discovery/Listing** - Implement `/admin/policy/list` endpoint:
  - Add metadata to policy classes (name, description, example, use_case)
  - Implement policy scanning/registration in PolicyManager
  - Return list of available policies with metadata for UI
- [ ] Update README post v2-migration
- [ ] **Verify UI monitoring endpoints functionality** - Check which UI endpoints are working and refactor as needed:
  - Test `/debug/diff` - diff viewer with side-by-side comparisons
  - Test `/activity/monitor` - real-time activity stream
  - Test `/debug/calls/{call_id}/diff` - API endpoint for diffs
  - Test `/debug/calls` - recent calls listing
  - Test `/activity/stream` - SSE endpoint
  - Verify transaction recorder is storing both original and final requests/responses
  - Check if debug routes are properly mounted in main.py
  - Refactor/fix any broken endpoints
- [ ] **Factor out common gateway route logic** - `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/messages` endpoints have significant duplication:
  - Both create the same pipeline dependencies (recorder, executor, formatter, orchestrator)
  - Both call `process_request()` and `record_request()` identically
  - Both handle streaming/non-streaming with identical patterns
  - Extract common pipeline setup into `_create_pipeline_components()` helper function
  - Would reduce code duplication from ~90 lines each to ~20 lines each
  - Main differences are: request format conversion (Anthropic→OpenAI) and response format conversion (OpenAI→Anthropic)
- [ ] **Make policy selection easier for e2e testing** - Allow temporary policy specification without modifying config files:
- [ ] **Policy API: Prevent common streaming mistakes** - Make it easier for policy writers to avoid streaming bugs:
  - Consider base class that auto-forwards chunks by default (opt-in buffering instead of opt-in forwarding)
  - Provide better helper functions for common patterns (send_content, send_blocked_message, etc.)
  - Add validation/warnings when policies don't forward chunks
  - Consider dependency injection for chunk creation to ensure correct types
- [ ] **Format blocked messages for readability** - Current blocked messages are ugly (backslashes, no newlines). Need to:
  - Pretty-print JSON tool arguments
  - Add proper line breaks in explanations
  - Consider terminal/web formatting differences
- [ ] Add security documentation for dynamic policy loading mechanism (POLICY_CONFIG) ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445270602))
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are documented in README and .env.example ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445270602))
- [ ] Add input validation: max request size and message count limits ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445272764))
- [ ] **Remove Prisma from codebase** - Prisma migrations conflict with SQL migrations in `./migrations/`:
  - Remove `prisma/` directory
  - Remove `db-migrations` service from docker-compose.yaml
  - Remove prisma from pyproject.toml dependencies
  - Remove prisma migrate steps from CI (.github/workflows/dev-checks.yaml)
  - SQL migrations in `./migrations/` already handle schema setup via docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
- [ ] **Fix assertion usage in production code** - Replace `assert` statements with proper error handling:
  - `simple_policy.py:69, 92` - Replace assertions with explicit `if` checks and raise proper exceptions
  - Assertions can be disabled with Python's `-O` flag, making them unreliable for production
  - Use `ValueError` or custom exceptions instead
- [ ] **Replace magic numbers with named constants**:
  - `queue_size: int = 10000` (policy_orchestrator.py:49) - should be named constant `DEFAULT_QUEUE_SIZE`
  - `max_chunks_queued: int = 4096` (transaction_recorder.py:19) - should be configurable via env var
  - Truncation length `[:200]` (policy_orchestrator.py:188) - should be `LOG_TRUNCATION_LENGTH`
  - Document rationale for queue sizes and benchmark for typical workloads
- [ ] **Improve error handling for OpenTelemetry spans** - Add defensive coding for when OTEL is not configured:
  - `DefaultObservabilityContext` assumes span is always valid (context.py:78-88)
  - Add checks: `if self.span and self.span.is_recording(): self.span.set_attribute(...)`
- [ ] **Review LiteLLMClient instantiation pattern** - Currently creates new instance per request (gateway_routes.py:134, 227):
  - Check if LiteLLM needs connection pooling or has startup overhead
  - Consider making it a singleton or FastAPI app state dependency
- [ ] **Add logging for chunk truncation** - Silent truncation should be more visible:
  - Log at ERROR level when chunks are truncated (transaction_recorder.py:96-101)
  - Add metrics/alerts for frequent truncation
  - Consider circuit breaking on sustained truncation
- [ ] **Add timeout configuration documentation** - Document why no timeout is set in gateway routes or make it configurable:
  - `PolicyExecutor(recorder=recorder)` uses default timeout of `None` (gateway_routes.py:117)
  - Either document rationale or add environment variable configuration

- [ ] Consolidate/organize utility/helper functions (see policies/utils.py)
- [ ] thinking and verbosity model flags not respected
- [ ] write SimpleToolCallJudge policy for pedagogical purposes
- [ ] improve docstrings for SimplePolicy

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Convert Loki validation scripts to e2e tests** - The manual validation scripts should be proper automated tests:
  - Convert [scripts/query_loki_fields.py](../scripts/query_loki_fields.py) to automated test
  - Convert [scripts/test_line_format.py](../scripts/test_line_format.py) to automated test
  - Convert [scripts/test_event_type.py](../scripts/test_event_type.py) to automated test
  - Tests should verify that observability events flow correctly through Promtail to Loki
  - Verify labels are correctly set (app, record_type, pipeline_stage, logger, trace_id)
  - Verify structured metadata is correctly set (transaction_id, payload)
  - Verify LogQL queries work as expected
- [ ] **Add missing integration tests for error recovery paths**:
  - Database failure scenarios (what happens when db_pool connection fails mid-request?)
  - Redis failure scenarios (event_publisher connection errors during event emission)
  - Policy timeout recovery (verify system recovers gracefully after policy timeout)
  - Network failures during LLM calls
  - Malformed response handling from upstream providers
- [ ] **Improve module-level docstrings** - Replace placeholder docstrings with descriptive ones:
  - `transaction_recorder.py:4` has `"""Module docstring."""` - should describe purpose
  - Follow pattern from well-documented modules like `anthropic_sse_assembler.py`
- [ ] **Audit all tests for unjustified conditional logic** - Review all test files (unit, integration, e2e) and remove conditional logic that checks for optional behavior. Tests should assert expected behavior, not conditionally validate. Exceptions: helper functions for parsing, format validation logic, legitimate expected variance in responses. Reference: test_streaming_chunk_structure.py cleanup as example.
- [ ] remove unnecessary string-matching test conditions (e.g. matching exception messages)
- [ ] **DB Migration: call_id -> transaction_id** - Rename database columns for consistency:
  - Create migration to rename `call_id` to `transaction_id` in all tables (conversation_calls, conversation_events, policy_events, etc.)
  - Update Prisma schema to use `transactionId` (maps to `transaction_id`)
  - Update all storage layer code to use `transaction_id` parameter
  - Note: Logs already use `transaction_id` (high cardinality, not a Loki label)
- [ ] Revisit ignored pyright issues
- [ ] Make filtering on the activity monitor easier and more intuitive
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware (slowapi or custom FastAPI middleware) ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445272764))
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker for upstream calls ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445272764))
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics endpoint ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445272764))
- [ ] Implement proper task tracking for event publisher (replace fire-and-forget) ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445272764))
- [ ] Add integration tests for error recovery paths ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445272764))
- [ ] Factor out env var logic into centralized config
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for V2 gateway ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445270602))
- [ ] Document production deployment best practices ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445270602))
- [ ] Add resource limits to docker-compose.yaml (mem_limit, cpus) ([review](https://github.com/LuthienResearch/luthien-proxy/pull/46#issuecomment-3445272764))
