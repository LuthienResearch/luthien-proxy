# TODO

- [ ] Consolidate DB interactions behind a persistent session or client wrapper
- [ ] Fail fast when DB or Redis are unavailable in `engine.py` (drop best-effort mode)
- [ ] Re-evaluate `PolicyEngine`; either overhaul it or remove it
- [x] Replace print statements with structured logging
- [ ] Break up `app.py` into smaller focused modules
- [ ] 99% unit test coverage
