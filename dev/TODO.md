# TODO

- [ ] consolidate db interactions with a persistant session/client
- [ ] remove dumbass 'best effort' behavior' and fail hard if DB/Redis are not available (engine.py)
- [ ] PolicyEngine seems very dumb in a few ways, should be overhauled/removed
- [ ] logging instead of printing
- [ ] refactor app.py (break it up)
- [ ] update AGENTS/CLAUDE with branch/log strategy
