# Objective: Onboarding & Value Prop Improvements

**Trello:** (to be linked)

## Goal

Improve onboarding experience and value prop communication based on user feedback from Seldon accelerator kickoff meetings.

## Completed

- [x] README restructure: hero section, value prop first, simplified quickstart
- [x] .env.example: clear REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL sections
- [x] DeSlop policy: simple text replacement for AI-isms (em-dashes)
- [x] Finn & Esben feedback captured in NOTES.md

## Remaining (Jai's domain)

- Priority 1: Hosted SaaS endpoint
- Priority 2: Thinking blocks + streaming bug fix
- Priority 3: API refactor (stop collapsing formats)
- Priority 4: Simplify infrastructure (Redis removal)

## Key Themes from Feedback

1. Value prop is buried - README leads with quickstart, not what Luthien does
2. Users want to use their OWN Claude Code - just set env vars
3. "Create your own policy" is the hook - should be prominent
4. Docker/port info missing - users don't know what's spinning up
5. Launcher script is a barrier - feels like losing control of your client
