# Current Objective: Evaluate Outsourcing QA + Bug Fixing

## Goal
Systematically evaluate whether to outsource:
1. **QA** - manual testing, regression testing, bug detection
2. **Bug fixing** - using Claude Code/Codex or contractors to fix detected bugs

## Context
- 13 years financial runway (cost is secondary to success probability)
- Potential $3-7M funding at Demo Day (April 2026)
- Prior: Outsourcing worth it to increase usability and get customer traction
- Divide and conquer: Claude Code for codebase analysis, Claude Desktop for vendor research

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bug analysis with categories (in NOTES.md)
- [ ] Assessment of what QA would/wouldn't catch
- [ ] Assessment of what could be outsourced for fixing
- [ ] Cost-benefit framework
- [ ] If proceed: recommended model with rationale
- [ ] Claude Desktop prompt for vendor/service research
