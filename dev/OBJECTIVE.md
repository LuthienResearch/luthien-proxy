# Objective: COMPLETED - Demo Web Interface

Built a presentation-ready web interface for the AI Control demo.

## What Was Delivered

1. **Demo UI at `/ui/demo`** ([demo.html](src/luthien_proxy/control_plane/templates/demo.html:1))
   - Side-by-side comparison of "Without AI Control" vs "With AI Control"
   - Shows user's benign prompt ("Show me customer 123")
   - Displays AI attempting harmful SQL (`DROP TABLE customers`)
   - Clear visual indicators for blocked vs allowed operations

2. **Modern Styling** ([demo.css](src/luthien_proxy/control_plane/static/demo.css:1))
   - Dark theme with professional appearance
   - Responsive layout suitable for presentations
   - Visual indicators: red for harmful, green for protected
   - Animated progression through demo stages

3. **Interactive Demo** ([demo.js](src/luthien_proxy/control_plane/static/demo.js:1))
   - Click "Run Demo" to see animated demonstration
   - Fetches examples from `/demo/examples` endpoint
   - Displays policy decisions and reasoning
   - Reset capability to run demo multiple times

4. **Backend Support** ([demo_routes.py](src/luthien_proxy/control_plane/demo_routes.py:1))
   - `/demo/examples` endpoint returns pre-defined scenarios
   - Static examples for reliable presentations
   - Separates UI demo from live testing (`scripts/run_demo.py`)

5. **Policy Configurations**
   - [demo_judge.yaml](config/demo_judge.yaml:1) - ToolCallJudgePolicy config
   - [demo_noop.yaml](config/demo_noop.yaml:1) - NoOpPolicy config

## Testing

✅ Navigate to http://localhost:8081/ui/demo - interface loads correctly
✅ Click "Run Demo" - animated demonstration runs smoothly
✅ Visual indicators clearly show blocked vs allowed operations
✅ Interface is polished and presentation-ready
✅ All dev checks pass

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/ui/demo` and see the demo interface
- [x] See clear visual indicators showing blocked vs allowed operations
- [x] Interface is polished enough for live demonstrations
- Note: Changed approach from live policy switching to static examples for more reliable demos
