# Objective: Value Proposition / Website

Clarify and communicate Luthien's value proposition.

## Inspiration

**OpenHands** (https://openhands.dev/ | [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands)) - Good example of clear value prop presentation:
- Leads with concrete promise: "Scale from one to thousands of agents"
- Emphasizes differentiators: open source, model-agnostic, enterprise-grade control
- Shows real use cases (code review, test coverage, bug fixing)
- Positions as infrastructure, not chatbot replacement
- "Works where you do" - integrates with existing workflows (GitHub, GitLab, Slack, CI/CD)

## Research

**Tagline Research (Feb 2026)**: `/Users/scottwofford/build/luthien-site-ideas/inspire_v2/`
- Analysis of 16 developer infra landing pages (Vercel, Railway, Supabase, LangChain, etc.)
- Top 3 tagline recommendations with rationale
- Key finding: **"Let AI code. Stay in control."** (primary recommendation)
