# Objective: Capture Onboarding & Value Prop Feedback

**Trello:** (to be linked)

## Goal

Consolidate user feedback about onboarding experience and value prop communication. This branch captures feedback only - implementation is separate.

## Feedback Sources

1. **Zac S. (Counterweight)** - 2026-01-27 call, detailed in NOTES.md
2. **Finn** - 2026-01-27, "ship the smallest useful thing, make it super easy to use"
3. **Esben** - (to be added)

## Key Themes

1. Value prop is buried - README leads with quickstart, not what Luthien does
2. Users want to use their OWN Claude Code - just set env vars
3. "Create your own policy" is the hook - currently buried at bottom
4. Docker/port info missing - users don't know what's spinning up
5. Launcher script is a barrier - feels like losing control of your client

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Zac's feedback captured in NOTES.md with specific quotes
- [ ] Finn's feedback captured
- [ ] Esben's feedback captured
- [ ] Ready to inform implementation work
