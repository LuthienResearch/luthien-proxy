# Current Objective

## Session Viewer Quick Wins (Story 6, Chunk 1)

**Goal**: Improve the `/history` session viewer with quick UI wins for dogfooding.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Gateway homepage has link to Conversation History (`/history`)
- [x] Session list shows actual start/end timestamps (not just relative time)
- [x] Sessions show first user message as preview (for at-a-glance recognition)
- [x] README updated: guardrails moved to Wave 3 (depends on context-aware policy base)
