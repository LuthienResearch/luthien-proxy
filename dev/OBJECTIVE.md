# Objective: COMPLETED

Built an enhanced conversation live view UI at `/ui/conversation/live` with original vs final tracking.

## What Was Delivered

1. **New HTML template** ([conversation_live_v2.html](src/luthien_proxy/control_plane/templates/conversation_live_v2.html:1)) with clean, modern layout
2. **JavaScript implementation** ([conversation_live_v2.js](src/luthien_proxy/control_plane/static/conversation_live_v2.js:1)) that:
   - Loads existing conversations from DB via snapshot API
   - Streams live updates via Redis SSE
   - Tracks original and final versions for both requests and responses
   - Displays side-by-side comparisons with visual highlighting of modifications
3. **CSS stylesheet** ([conversation_live_v2.css](src/luthien_proxy/control_plane/static/conversation_live_v2.css:1)) with polished styling
4. **Updated route** in [ui.py](src/luthien_proxy/control_plane/ui.py:56) to serve the new template

## Features

- **Sidebar** shows recent calls and allows manual call ID entry
- **DB snapshot loading** fetches historical conversation data from database
- **Live Redis streaming** updates the view in real-time as new events arrive
- **Original vs Final tracking** displays side-by-side comparisons for:
  - Request messages (before and after policy transformation)
  - Response content (before and after policy transformation)
- **Visual highlighting** clearly shows which messages/responses were modified
- **Status indicators** show call status (pending, streaming, success, failure)
- **Auto-refresh** periodically refreshes snapshot data during streaming

## Testing

Verified with:
- Multiple test requests through the proxy
- UI loads and displays recent calls correctly
- Click on call loads DB snapshot
- Live streaming works with SSE connection
- Original vs final comparison displays correctly

All acceptance criteria met.
