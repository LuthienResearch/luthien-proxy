# Gotchas

Non-obvious behaviors, edge cases, and things that are easy to get wrong.

## Testing (2025-10-08, updated 2025-10-24)

- E2E tests (`pytest -m e2e`) are SLOW - use sparingly, prefer unit tests for rapid iteration
- Always run `./scripts/dev_checks.sh` before committing - formats, lints, type-checks, and tests
- **OTel disabled in tests**: Set `OTEL_ENABLED=false` in test environment to avoid connection errors to Tempo endpoint. Module-level `tracer = trace.get_tracer()` calls trigger OTel initialization at import time.
- **LiteLLM type warnings**: When working with `ModelResponse`, use proper typed objects (`Choices`, `StreamingChoices`, `Message`, `Delta`) to avoid Pydantic serialization warnings from LiteLLM's `Union` types. See test fixtures for examples.
- **V1 e2e tests removed**: Only V2 e2e tests remain (test_v2_api_compatibility.py). V1 tests tested deleted infrastructure and were removed.

## Docker Development (2025-10-08, updated 2025-10-24)

- Use `docker compose restart v2-gateway` to iterate on code changes
- Check logs with `docker compose logs -f v2-gateway` when debugging
- Long-running compose or `uv` commands can hang the CLI; launch them via `scripts/run_bg_command.sh` so you can poll logs (`tail -f`) and terminate with the recorded PID if needed.
- **V1 services removed**: control-plane, litellm-proxy, and dummy-provider services are deleted. Only v2-gateway, local-llm, db, and redis remain.

## Observability Checks (2025-10-08, updated 2025-10-24)

- **V1 e2e helpers removed**: V1 e2e test helpers (policy_assertions.py, infra.py, etc.) were deleted along with V1 infrastructure
- V2 uses OpenTelemetry for observability - see `dev/observability-v2.md` and `dev/VIEWING_TRACES_GUIDE.md`
- Live activity monitoring available at `/v2/activity/monitor` on the V2 gateway

## Documentation Structure (2025-10-10, updated 2025-10-24)

**Gotcha**: V1 documentation archived, V2 documentation is canonical

- **V1 docs archived**: docs/archive/ contains v1-ARCHITECTURE.md, v1-developer-onboarding.md, v1-diagrams.md, v1-reading-guide.md
- **V2 docs active**: dev/ARCHITECTURE.md, dev/event_driven_policy_guide.md, dev/observability-v2.md, dev/VIEWING_TRACES_GUIDE.md
- **Public docs location changed**: Main documentation moved from docs/ to dev/ for V2
- **Common places to check**: README.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, dev planning docs, inline code comments
- **Streaming behavior (V2)**: V2 emits conversation events via `v2/storage/events.py` using background queue for non-blocking persistence

## Queue Shutdown for Stream Termination (2025-01-20, updated 2025-10-20)

**Gotcha**: Use `asyncio.Queue.shutdown()` for stream termination, not `None` sentinel values

- **Why**: Python 3.11+ built-in queue shutdown raises `QueueShutDown` when drained - cleaner than sentinel patterns
- **Wrong**: Putting `None` (gets consumed/lost during batch draining)
- **Right**: Call `queue.shutdown()` to signal end; catch `QueueShutDown` exception
- **Batch processing**: Block with `await queue.get()` for first item (don't busy-wait with `get_nowait()` in loop!)
- **Why it matters**: Busy-wait consumes 100% CPU; proper blocking is essential for async efficiency
