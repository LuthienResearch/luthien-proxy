# Context Directory

This directory contains historical context and design feedback that informed the V2 observability implementation.

## Active Documents

- **[`observability-guide.md`](observability-guide.md)** - General observability patterns and OpenTelemetry setup

## Historical Documents (Archived)

These documents provided important feedback during the design phase but are superseded by [`dev/observability-v2.md`](../observability-v2.md):

- **`claude_observability_feedback.txt`** - Identified key blockers (duplicate storage, synchronous writes)
- **`observability_review_summary.md`** - Summarized architectural decisions
- **`observability-architecture-proposal.md`** - Original four-layer architecture proposal

**Do not update these documents.** They serve as historical reference only.

## Current Implementation

For the current V2 observability status and plan, see:
- [`dev/observability-v2.md`](../observability-v2.md) - **Single source of truth** for V2 observability
