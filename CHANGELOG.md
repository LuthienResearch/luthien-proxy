# CHANGELOG

## DEVELOPMENT | TBA

- development framework
- litellm integration
- in-depth hook logging
- request/response inspection UX
- shared redis/db client provisioning and pooling

## 0.0.0 | 2025-11-22

- This is an example entry in an example release section (0.0.0)
- 0.0.0 designates the version number
- Update this section as objectives are completed
- Typically multiple objectives will be included in a given release
- Releases are listed in descending chronological order
- The most recent release is always at the top of the file; this should be the only entry that changes
- In development, the in-progress entry will typically be labeled as version `DEVELOPMENT` with release date `TBA`
- The in-development release section will be updated to a proper version number with release date when it's time to release a new version (this is a human decision)
- Each bullet in a release section should link back to the objective handle (e.g., `[policy-engine cleanup](policy-engine-cleanup)`) so we can trace work quickly
